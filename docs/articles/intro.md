# General project goals

- Proficiency with Q# as a programming language
- Understanding the role of qRAM in quantum computing, its benefits, and costs
- Describe the different memory paradigms in quantum machine learning

### Bonus goals

- Actually run a small qRAM on a quantum machine; how well does it work?
- Describe the different types of classical RAM
- Describe how one might implement a qRAM in hardware

## Key Deliverables

- Q# Library, to be released open-source
  - Implementations:
    - [ ] Bucket-brigade (original circuit model, and updated constant-depth model)
    - [ ] Various qROMs
    - [ ] Quantum state preparation ("select/SWAP" oracles)
    - [ ] Application-specific qROMs
  - Samples:
    - [ ] Instantiation and querying all implemented qRAMs/qROMs
    - [ ] Resource estimation
- Written report about the different methods used
